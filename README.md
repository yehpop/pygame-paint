# pygame-paint
A Paint Program made using [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/tree/main) and [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui)  

# usage
Requires pygame and pygame_gui, check their respective github repositories from the links above.
The program is run through paint.py...
It is not complete, this was a project i had to get better at python. I am unsure if i will continue.

# features
Basic features like opening files, creating new canvases, saving to a location on your pc etc.\
The program has 3 themes (default, light and dark)\
THE BUCKET TOOL IS NOT ADDED AT THE MOMENT PRESSING THE BUTTON WILL CRASH THE PROGRAM\
Undo and Redo work but, you have to reclick on the canvas window to refocus... I'm gonna try and improve this\
You can also use Ctrl+Z to undo and Ctrl+Shift+Z to redo
